            <h2>A Slice of Bloomer History</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Blommer Chocolate is a fully integrated chocolate and cocoa manufacturer serving customers around the world. Our company was founded in 1939 in Chicago, Illinois by Henry Blommer, Sr., along with his brothers Al and Bernard.</li>
                <li>By 1948, our business warranted further expansion. We branched out nationally with the addition of Blommer Chocolate Factory of California in Los Angeles. In 1952, Blommer purchased the common stock of Boldemann Chocolate of San Francisco. Both the southern California and San Francisco operations were consolidated in 1970 when a new facility was built in Union City, California.</li>
                <li> We expanded once again to meet the demands of increasing business when we built a new plant in East Greenville, Pa in 1980 and again in 2001 when we added 85,000 square feet to our East Greenville facility. Most recently, in 2006, we purchased an 85,000-squarefoot manufacturing facility in Campbellford, Ontario. The company’s four factories are located strategically across North America giving us the unique ability to respond quickly to our customers’ needs.
                </li>
                <li>Today, the business has grown to become the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America. With four generations of chocolate makers behind us, Blommer offers continuity in this climate of competition and consolidation.</li>
                <li>Our current success is a direct result of our dedication to the Blommer brothers’ founding principles — quality, consistency and concern for the customer. At the same time, we have maintained the flexibility to respond to your needs, enabling us to deliver service with superior value.</li>
